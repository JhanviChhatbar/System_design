**Problem Statement: Design an Elevator System**

**Objective:**
Design a scalable and efficient elevator system that can handle multiple elevators in a building with various floors while optimizing passenger wait and travel times.

**Requirements:**
1. Functional Requirements:
âœ… Multiple Elevators: The system should support multiple elevators operating simultaneously.
âœ… Handling Requests:

Passengers should be able to request an elevator from a floor (Up/Down request).
Passengers inside the elevator should be able to choose their destination floor.
âœ… Efficient Scheduling: The system should decide which elevator should handle a request efficiently (e.g., nearest available elevator).
âœ… Elevator Status: Each elevator should have the following states:
Moving Up
Moving Down
Idle
Door Opening/Closing
âœ… Handling Edge Cases:
Overloaded elevators should stop accepting new passengers.
Emergency stop mechanism for safety.
Power failure handling.
2. Non-Functional Requirements:

âš¡ Scalability: Should handle large buildings with multiple floors and many elevators.

âš¡ Concurrency: Multiple users can interact with the system simultaneously.

âš¡ Low Latency: Quick response to floor requests.

âš¡ Fault Tolerance: Should recover from failures and resume operation smoothly.


**Logic**

ðŸ”¹ Elevator Enhancements:

Used a PriorityQueue to sort requests dynamically based on the elevatorâ€™s current direction.
Ensures requests are processed efficiently (ascending for UP, descending for DOWN).

ðŸ”¹ Scheduler Improvements:

Chooses the nearest available elevator that is either idle or moving in the request's direction.
Ensures elevators avoid unnecessary direction changes, improving efficiency.

ðŸ”¹ processRequests() Logic:

Continuously polls requests from the queue until all are processed.
Opens and closes doors efficiently to simulate real-world behavior.

Design Patterns Used in the Elevator System
This implementation incorporates several key design patterns:

1. Singleton Pattern
Where Used: RequestManager and Scheduler can be designed as Singletons to ensure only one instance is created and shared across the system.
Purpose: Ensures controlled access to shared resources like elevator assignment logic.
2. Strategy Pattern
Where Used: The Scheduler class employs the Strategy Pattern to implement various scheduling algorithms like LOOK, SCAN, or FCFS.
Purpose: This pattern allows you to switch between different scheduling strategies without modifying the core logic.
âœ… Improvement Idea: Refactor Scheduler with an interface like SchedulingStrategy to make it more flexible.

interface SchedulingStrategy {
    Elevator findBestElevator(List<Elevator> elevators, int floor, Direction direction);
}
3. Command Pattern
Where Used: The addRequest() method in the Elevator class acts as a Command, queueing floor requests for later execution.
Purpose: It separates the request from the execution logic, improving flexibility and scalability.
4. Observer Pattern
Where Used: The DisplayPanel can be improved to implement the Observer Pattern, where it subscribes to elevator state changes and updates the display accordingly.
Purpose: Keeps the UI updated without tightly coupling it to the elevator logic.
5. Factory Pattern (Potential Enhancement)
Where Used (Improvement Idea): The creation of elevators inside ElevatorSystem can follow the Factory Pattern for better scalability when adding different elevator types (e.g., Freight Elevator, Passenger Elevator, etc.).
Summary of Design Patterns
âœ… Singleton â†’ For RequestManager and Scheduler instances
âœ… Strategy â†’ For flexible scheduling algorithms
âœ… Command â†’ For request queuing and execution logic
âœ… Observer â†’ For real-time UI updates via DisplayPanel
âœ… Factory (Potential Improvement) â†’ For scalable elevator creation
